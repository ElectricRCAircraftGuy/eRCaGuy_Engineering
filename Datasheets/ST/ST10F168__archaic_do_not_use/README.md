The ST10F168 is _so old_ and obsolete, that not even ST has a datasheet for it anymore. Here are all of the datasheets they have on `ST10F*` chips: https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/search.html#q=st10f-t=resources-page=1. Keil has the datasheet instead:

It looks like this antiquated and obsolete 16-bit ST10F168 chip is more-or-less comparable to the Arduino Mega 2560's AVR ATmega2560 8-bit mcu, here: https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mega-2560-rev3, which is a good low-end chip.
